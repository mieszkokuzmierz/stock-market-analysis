## Features

- Download historical stock data (using `yfinance`).
- Plot stock price trends over time.
- Calculate daily returns and cumulative returns.
- Compute moving averages to analyze trends.
- Provide summary statistics of stock performance.

## Requirements

This project uses Python 3.10+ and the following main libraries:
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- yfinance  

(Install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt` – requirements file coming soon!)

```bash
python src/stock_analysis.py

Or open the notebook

jupyter notebook notebooks/stock_analysis.ipynb

Example Output
Stock price chart with moving averages
Daily returns visualization
Summary statistics (mean, volatility, max drawdown)

Next Steps

Compare multiple stocks (e.g., AAPL vs MSFT).
Add portfolio analysis (e.g., Sharpe ratio).
Extend with risk metrics and more advanced financial indicators.
